Welcome! My name is Max, I am Web-developer. I speciate for UI design and development client part of web-apps..I can not boast of many years of experience in commercial development. But I have several own projects on which I work with pleasure in my free time from the main work.
For all time, when i go in for programming and development, I understood that there are no impossible tasks. The main thing in any job, is to love your job, and understand why you doing this.
Some years ago, I understood that I want dedicate life to high technology development and contribute to this proces.
